<h2> Money Diaries of Reddit </h2/>

<h3> Project Description </h3/>
This python script uses the Reddit API to extract posts from the <em>r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE</em> subreddit. It filters posts based on the “Money Diary” flair and stores the data in a CSV file. <br/> 
<br/>
My inspiration for this project was my personal delight from reading Money Diaries. It’s fascinating how different individual’s money management styles are. Looking at things like housing costs, eating out, subscriptions, money saved, etc. <br/> 

<br/>
<h3> Future Work </h3/>
Money Diaries follow a template that consists of a few different sections however, not all posts include the same amount of details. My next step is to parse through the posts and break them down into meaningful categories - similar to the template format. <br/>

<br>
This project is ongoing.
