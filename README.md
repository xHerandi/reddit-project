<h2> Money Diaries of Reddit </h2/>

<h3> Project Description </h3/>
This python script uses Reddit’s API to extract posts from r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE subreddit. It filters posts based on the Money Diary flair created by this subreddit community. It then stores the data in a CSV file. <br/> 
<br/>
My inspiration for this project was my personal delight from reading Money Diaries. It’s fascinating how different people’s money management styles are. Most entries include information on things like housing costs, eating out, subscriptions, money saved, and investments amongst a few others. <br/> 

<br/>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3/>
<li> Python </li>
<br>
Open Source Libraries and Packages:
<br></br>
<li> Pandas </li>
<li> Praw </li>
<li> Settings </li>

<br>
<h3> Future Work </h3/>
Money Diaries follow a template that consists of a few different sections. However, not all posts include the same amount of details which makes extracting certain pieces of information challenging. My next step is to parse through the post contents and break them down into meaningful categories such as housing, total subscriptions, grocery costs etc. <br/>

This project is ongoing.
